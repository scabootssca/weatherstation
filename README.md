Very early pre-alpha whatever release of my weather station design


Needs ESP8266_Weather_Reporting_Module/login.h made with this format:
# login.h
```
#define SERVER_IP_ADDRESS "XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX"
#define MY_IP XXX, XXX, XXX, XXX
#define GATEWAY_IP XXX, XXX, XXX, XXX
#define SUBNET_MASK 255, XXX, XXX, XXX, XXX
#define WIFI_SSID "XXXXXXXXXXX"
#define WIFI_PASS "*******************"
```

It'll tell it what to connect to
